## How to use the files

First decide which files do you need.
You can find one folder with scripts and one with actions.

On the first picture you can see both types. Scripts can be found under Scripts, the actions are directly in the context menu.

### Prerequisites

Install PeaZip as a Flatpak from the Software Manager.
